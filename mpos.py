    # OutputMessage is relative to the Sender
    # InputMessage is relative to the Receiver
    # an OutputMessage is created by Send ()
    # an InputMessage is (normally) created by the Dispatcher during dumping of the output bucket of a Component after it has performed a reaction
    # the mapping from OutputMessage to InputMessage is defined in the Connections of the parent Container
    # [Connections is a routing table contained in the parent Container]
    # a container can:
    #  (1) route messages between its children, 
    #  (2) route its input to its children, 
    #  (3) route a child's output to its own output, 
    #  (4) route its own input to its own output
    #  (5) route a child's output to NOWHERE (N/C - no connection)
    #  (6) route its own input to NOWHERE (N/C)
    # IOW - a message is { id, data } where id is { component X tag }
    # the fact that "component" is always included in the id ensures that the message has relative addressing (relative to Sender or Receiver as appropriate)
    # Aside: "tag" is called "pin" in electronics, "tag" is called "topic" in pubsb (e.g. ROS)
    # Aside: N/C has no parallel in Functional notation, Natural Numbers vs. Whole Numbers (Naturals do not contain 0, Whole Numbers contain 0)
