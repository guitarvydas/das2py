![Message](./design-Message.svg)

An output message is:
- a component
- a pin
- data.

An input message has the same contents.

Input messages are enqueued on the `input-fifo` of Components.

Output messages are generated by `Send ()` and are enqueued in the output bucket of of the Dispatcher.  

A list of output messages is returned to the Dispatcher by the `react` method of Components.  

Output messages are always deferred.  Output messages are delivered to their corresponding receiver Components when the Dispatcher dumps its output bucket.  It is unspecified 'when' the Dispatcher dumps its output bucket, except that the dump occurs *after* the Component has reacted and has returned to the Dispatcher.
